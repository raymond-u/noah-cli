```

## Quickstart

To get started with Noah, use the `noah init` command to create a new project:

```bash
noah init my_project # This will by default create a Git repository
cd my_project
```

To add a new dataset to your project, use the `noah add` command:

```bash
noah add SRP123456 # ENCSR123ABC, GSE123456, etc. are also supported
```

You can also add privately hosted datasets:

```bash
noah add me@some_host:path/to/my_dataset ftp://ftp.example.com/another_dataset
```

If you share your project with others, they can easily retrieve the datasets you added:

```bash
noah install
```
